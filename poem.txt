Someday

Some place deep inside the dream, into the endless dark 
I temporarily get lost inside the thick layered fog and become distant

I reach my hand out in hopes it’ll touch 
But I go round and round, will I wander once more

Someday our night will probably all pass too right 
Even when the endless dark comes I will never be scared again 
Let’s hold our hands tightly together 
And I will walk the ends of the dark together with you 

Look at the starlight in the night sky that has lighted the long night 
The dreams that we have wished for together, are lighting the sky there 

When the stars we embroidered shine their light on us 
Then I will take another step forward

Someday our night will probably all pass too right 
Even when the endless dark comes 
I will never be scared again 
Let’s hold our hands tightly together 
And I will walk the ends of the dark together with you 

Even if the road is long, let’s continue to hold our hands tight together 
And walk the endless road 

Someday when we look at each other, we will probably put on a smile 
Since it’s us who will be together until the end 
I will never be scared again 
Let’s hold our hands tightly together 
And I will walk towards the bright light together with you.
